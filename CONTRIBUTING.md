# Contributing to Open 3D Engine Documentation

**First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute!**

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to **Open 3D Engine (O3DE)** documentation, hosted at [o3de.org](http://o3de.org/).
These are just guidelines, not rules. Use your best judgment, and feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull request.

## Before you get started

### Code of Conduct

Open 3D Engine follows the [Open 3D Foundation Code of Conduct](http://o3de.org/docs/contributing/code-of-conduct). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior to the
O3DE Code of Conduct Committee at &lt;conduct@o3de.org&gt;.

### Documentation and Site Decisions

The [O3DE SIG Docs Mailing List](https://lists.o3de.org/g/sig-docs-community) is the discussion group for doc releases, suggested site improvements, and improving the doc contribution experience. If you plan to be a regular contributor, join this group to stay informed and involved.

### Style Guides and Templates

Before creating a pull request to update or create new content, please review the [O3DE Style Guide](https://o3de.org/docs/contributing/to-docs/style-guide/).

## Contributing to Documentation

### Reporting Documentation Issues

The `o3de.org` website uses GitHub Issues to track documentation issues and requests. If you see a documentation issue, submit an issue using the following steps:

1. Check the [o3de.org issues list](https://github.com/o3de/o3de.org/issues) to see if your issue is already reported.
2. Use the [included template for every new issue](https://github.com/o3de/o3de.org/issues/new/choose).  When you create a bug report, include as many details as possible. If you have a suggestion for a fix already, submit it as a pull request!

Note that code issues should be filed against the main O3DE repository, while documentation issues should go in the o3de.org repository.

### Submitting Documentation Pull Requests

If you're fixing an issue that's relevant to the latest release of O3DE, you should submit a PR that targets the `main` branch of the `o3de.org` repo. Issues that are relevant only to other versions of O3DE (such as `development`) should target the matching branch of the `o3de.org` repo. For more information about creating a pull request, refer to the [Submitting docs](https://o3de.org/docs/contributing/to-docs/get-started#submitting-docs).

For more information, see [contributing to O3DE documentation](https://o3de.org/docs/contributing/to-docs/).

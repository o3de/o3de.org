A *render pipeline* describes a sequence of steps to render a 3D scene on a 2D screen. In **Atom Renderer**, the render pipeline is completely modular and driven by a series of passes. This lets you customize the render pipeline for features such as shadows, lighting, and post effects. You can also completely change the rendering technique, for example, to Deferred, Checkerboard, or Forward+. By default, Atom implements *Forward+* rendering in its pre-built render pipelines.

Atom's pre-built render pipelines are ready to use and encompass common use cases for **Open 3D Engine (O3DE)**:
- **Main Rendering Pipeline**: The default render pipeline for Windows, Linux, and macOS platforms. 
- **Low-end Rendering Pipeline**: The default render pipeline for iOS and Android platforms.

The render pipeline consists of a root pass that drives a collection of passes to handle different graphics techniques in the render pipeline. For more information, refer to the [Pass System](/docs/atom-guide/dev-guide/passes/pass-system/) section.


## Supported features in pre-built render pipelines

This table lists the features that are supported by the Main Rendering Pipeline and the Low-end Rendering Pipeline by default.

## File structure

A render pipeline is stored as an `.azasset` file, which is a JSON file that links to the root pass of the render pipeline and contains other configurations. In this file, the `RootPassTemplate` parameter contains the name of pipeline's root pass.

The following example is the `MainRenderPipeline.azasset` file. The root pass template is called `MainPipeline`, which links to the `MainPipeline.pass` file. 
```json
{
    "Type": "JsonSerialization",
    "Version": 1,
    "ClassName": "RenderPipelineDescriptor",
    "ClassData": {
        "Name": "MainPipeline",
        "MainViewTag": "MainCamera",
        "RootPassTemplate": "MainPipeline",
        "RenderSettings": {
            "MultisampleState": {
                "samples": 4
            }
        }
    }
}

```


You can find the following render pipeline files in your O3DE engine source:
- **Main Rendering Pipeline**: `Gems\Atom\Feature\Common\Assets\Passes\MainRenderPipeline.azasset`
- **Low-end Rendering Pipeline**: `Gems\Atom\Feature\Common\Assets\Passes\LowEndRenderPipeline.azasset`


## Modifying the render pipeline

Because modular passes drive the render pipeline, it's more accessible to add or remove passes and update connections. You can modify the main render pipeline or create a custom render pipeline for your team. You might want to use a custom render pipeline for a number of reasons, such as to:

- Develop new features that impact the render pipeline.
- Implement and use alternative rendering techniques.
- Improve rendering performance.

Modifying the render pipeline involves enabling or disabling a pass and updating the connections. You can do this directly by manually editing the `MainPipeline.pass` with a text editor.

To enable or disable a pass in the render pipeline: 
1. In the render pipeline's `.pass` file, find the pass that you want to enable or disable in the `PassRequests` list. 
2. Set the `Enabled` property to true or false.
   
When you enable or disable a pass, the pass system automatically updates the connections in the pass hierarchy. This requires that you've set up fallback connections. For more information, refer to [PassTemplate File Specification](/docs/atom-guide/dev-guide/passes/pass-template-file-spec/)

For example, in the `PassRequests` section of the `MainPipeline.pass`, disable `DeferredFogPass` in the render pipeline by setting `Enabled` to false.
```JSON
    "PassRequests": [

        ...
        
        {
            "Name": "DeferredFogPass",
            "TemplateName": "DeferredFogPassTemplate",
            "Enabled": false,
            "Connections": [
                ...
            ],
            "PassData": { ... }
        },
        
        ...
    ]
```

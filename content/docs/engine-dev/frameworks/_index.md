The **Open 3D Engine (O3DE) Frameworks** are the set of libraries shipped as the core elements of O3DE. Frameworks are the low-level libraries responsible for providing support that Gems and project code can build on top of, allowing users to customize their O3DE projects on top of a common SDK for the platform.

# Scene Processing Gem {#gems-system-gem-scene-processing}

Use the Scene Processing gem to specify the default settings for processing scene files such as `.fbx` for your games\. For example, you can use the FBX Settings tool to specify the file types and settings that you want for your `.fbx` files\. Asset Processor then processes the files so that they are available in the **Asset Browser**\.

The Scene Processing gem is required and enabled by default for Lumberyard projects\.

For information about working with file types and settings, see [Customize FBX asset export with FBX Settings](/docs/user-guide/features/assets/fbx-settings/intro.md)\.

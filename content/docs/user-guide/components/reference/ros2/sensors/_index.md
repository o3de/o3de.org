Refer to the [Robotics](/docs/user-guide/interactivity/robotics) documentation to learn more about robotics simulation features of O3DE.

`ROS2Sensors` Gem contains components for creating and publishing data of simulated robot sensors. This includes cameras, lidars, imu, gnss, and other sensors. The components are designed to be easily configurable and extendable, allowing you to create custom sensor types as needed.

More details about the gnss and lidar sensor components can be found in the following pages:
-  [GNSS Sensor Component](./ros2-gnss-sensor.md)
-  [Lidar Sensor component](./ros2-lidar-sensor.md)

linktitle: Georeference Level Component
description: The Georeference Level component enables you to specify the geographical location of your simulation within the Robot Operating System (ROS 2) in Open 3D Engine (O3DE).
---

The **Georeference Level** component allows you to choose the geographical location of your simulation. This component is a level component and should be added to the level entity. If you are using, for example, the [GNSS Sensor Component](../sensors/ros2-gnss-sensor.md), it complements its functionality.

## Provider

[LevelGeoreferencing Gem](/docs/user-guide/gems/reference/robotics/ros2)

## Dependencies

None

| Property                 | Description                                                                                                              | Values  | Default |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------- | ------- |
| **Altitude**             | The elevation of the ENU origin entity above Earth's WGS84 ellipsoid                                                     | meters  | 0       |
| **Latitude**             | The north-south geographical coordinate in WGS84, where north is positive                                                | degrees | 0       |
| **Longitude**            | The east-west geographical coordinate in WGS84, where east is positive                                                   | degrees | 0       |
| **ENU Origin Transform** | Entity that has a geographical location assigned, and its local coordinate system follows ENU (East-North-Up) directions | Entity  |         |
 
## Usage

1. Identify a location in your level with a known geographical position. This could be a corner of a building or an intersection of roads.
2. Create an empty entity in known location.
3. Rotate the entity so that its local coordinate system aligns with mapping:
   - X should point East.
   - Y should point North.
   - Z should point up.
4. In the **Georeference Level component**, enter the geographical location of the entity and set the **ENU Origin Transform** to reference the entity mentioned above.

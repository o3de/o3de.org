<!-- # O3DE Simulation Interfaces Gem -->

The **Simulation Interfaces Gem** allows to control the simulation and the simulation environment in **Open 3D Engine (O3DE)** using the standardized ROS 2 [simulation_interfaces](https://github.com/ros-simulation/simulation_interfaces) package.  The Gem contains the O3DE implementation together with the API based on the EBuses, as well as the ROS 2 interface to allow communication with O3DE via the ROS 2 framework.

The `SimulationInterfaces` Gem requires:
- [ROS 2 Gem](/docs/user-guide/gems/reference/robotics/ros2.md) enabled.
- [simulation_interfaces](https://github.com/ros-simulation/simulation_interfaces) package installed.

Please see the [Simulation Interfaces](/docs/user-guide/interactivity/robotics/simulation-interfaces.md) documentation for more information on how to use this Gem.

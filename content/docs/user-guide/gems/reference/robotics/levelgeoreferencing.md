<!-- # O3DE Level Georeferencing Gem -->

The **Level Georeferencing Gem** provides a way to reference real-world coordinates in **Open 3D Engine (O3DE)** levels. It allows you to align your O3DE levels with real-world locations, which is particularly useful for applications such as robotics simulations, urban planning, and geographic information systems (GIS).

Please see the [Level Georeferencing](/docs/user-guide/interactivity/georeference.md) documentation for more information on how to use this Gem.

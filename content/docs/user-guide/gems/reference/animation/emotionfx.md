Add the Emotion FX Animation Gem to your **Open 3D Engine (O3DE)** project to enable **Animation Editor**. Animation Editor provides an intuitive node-based system for controlling actor behavior with animation graphs. You can visually build hierarchal state machines and blend trees driven by parameters and events to animate rigged actors.

Animation Editor includes tools for building the following:

* Motion sets
* Motion graphs
* Transition conditions
* Blend spaces
* Sync tracking
* Motion events
* Mirroring animation
* Retargeting animation
* Animation controllers
* Physics simulation of objects attached to actors
* Cloth colliders

Animation Editor uses  `.actor` and `.motion` files generated from `.fbx` assets.

For more information, refer to the [Animation overview](/docs/user-guide/visualization/animation/).

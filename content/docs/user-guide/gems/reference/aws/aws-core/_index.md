The **AWS Core** Gem lets you use AWS services from within O3DE. Other AWS Gems typically have a dependency on this Gem since it provides the common mechanisms to do the following:
* Set up the required AWS SDK for C++.
* Configure platform clients.
* Make HTTPS RESTful calls.
* Handle generic responses and errors
* Set up and use AWS credentials.

## Features

The AWS Core Gem has the following key features:

* Initializes, [configures](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-cpp/v1/developer-guide/configuring.html), and terminates the [AWS SDK for C++](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-cpp/v1/developer-guide/welcome.html).
    * Includes platform extensions for the SDK for C++.
    * Provides a common client configuration ready for O3DE. Refer to [AWS Client configuration](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-cpp/v1/developer-guide/client-config.html) for details.

* Handles HTTPS calls to AWS services, including responses and errors.
* Lets you use AWS credentials, including existing AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI) profiles and roles, along with console variables (CVARs) for easier configuration. Refer to [Configuring AWS Credentials](./configuring-credentials/) for details.
* Supports AWS resource sharing, helping you identify AWS resources that you can use from O3DE.
* Provides utility functions that make it easier to work with AWS services and resources.

To enable the AWS Core Gem, do the following:

1. Use **O3DE Project Manager** or the command line to add the AWS Core Gem to your project.

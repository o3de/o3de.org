## Feature overview
The **AWS GameLift** Gem provides the following features:

**Amazon GameLift integration**
- A framework to extend the O3DE networking layer and to let the **Multiplayer** Gem work with Amazon's dedicated server solution, [Amazon GameLift](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/gamelift-intro.html). The AWS GameLift Gem provides integrations with both the [GameLift Server SDK](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/gamelift-supported.html#gamelift-supported-servers) and the AWS SDK client (to call the GameLift service itself).

**Build and package management**
- Instructions to package and optionally upload the dedicated server build.
- A sample [AWS Cloud Development Kit (AWS CDK)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/v2/guide/home.html) application. You can deploy the AWS CDK application to set up basic GameLift resources, or modify the application to meet your needs by adding or updating the deployed resources.

## Release highlights

- Support for CreateSession (on fleet/on queue), SearchSessions, JoinSession, and LeaveSession through GameLift.
- Support for FlexMatch including backfill through GameLift.
- Support for Windows/Linux dedicated servers and multi-platform client launchers.
- Support for AWS CDK applications to manage GameLift resources.

## Add modular features and assets with Gems

*Gems* are packages that contain code and assets to augment your game projects. With the Gem system, you can choose the features and assets that you need for your game project without including unnecessary components. For a list of all Gems included in **Open 3D Engine (O3DE)**, refer to [O3DE Gem Reference](reference).

O3DE features two types of Gems:

* **Code & Assets** - Contains assets as well as code that performs certain functions upon the assets.
* **Assets Only** - Contains only assets and no code.

All Gems that come bundled with O3DE are located in the `Gems` directory. Enabled Gems are detected and set as dependencies for your project by the O3DE [build system](/docs/user-guide/build).  For more information, refer to [Adding and Removing Gems in a Project](/docs/user-guide/project-config/add-remove-gems/).

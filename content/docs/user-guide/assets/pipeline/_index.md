The **Open 3D Engine (O3DE)** Asset Pipeline is the end-to-end process that generates runtime optimized product assets from source assets. These topics provide an overview of the entire Asset Pipeline including explanations of source assets, scan directories, **Asset Builders**, asset dependencies, and the **Asset Cache** that stores the product assets generated by the Asset Pipeline.

| Topic | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [Asset Processing](asset-processing) | A high level overview of how source assets are analyzed, and how product assets are generated. |
| [Source Assets](source-assets) |  Source assets can have custom processing options and are automatically processed in various scenarios. |
| [Scan Directories](scan-directories) | Scan directories are monitored for new and updated source assets. |
| [Asset Builders](asset-builders) | Asset Builders provide information for process jobs and generate product assets. |
| [Intermediate Assets](intermediate-assets) | Intermediate assets allow builders to be chained together and re-used. |
| [Asset Dependencies and Identifiers](asset-dependencies-and-identifiers) | Asset dependencies and identifiers ensure that asset references can be met when assets are processed, loaded, and packaged. |
| [Asset Cache](asset-cache) | The Asset Cache stores the runtime optimized product assets and the information **Asset Processor** needs to track assets and keep them up to date. |

# O3DE 24.09.0 Release Notes

Get ready for a game-changing update with the O3DE 24.09 release. This latest version is packed with fantastic enhancements driven by your feedback, focusing on turbocharging performance and elevating your experience. Now, with the installer version, you can build projects using only Script Canvas and Lua—no compiler needed\! But that’s just the beginning. We’ve supercharged editor startup times with up to a jaw-dropping 90% boost for large projects brimming with assets. Mobile developers, rejoice\! Enjoy a staggering 400% increase in performance on both iOS and Android, along with dramatically reduced runtime memory usage. For simulation use cases, we have added the Georeference component, ability to parse Gazebo data, and a ROS2FrameComponent, along with many simulation performance improvements. This release is bursting with hundreds of quality of life improvements and bug fixes. Dive in to explore just a few of the exciting highlights that 24.09 has in store.

See Simulation, Rendering, and AR/VR sections for specific changes in these areas.

## General Changes and Improvements in 24.09.0

**Major Improvements:**

* Quick-Start “Script Only” Projects \- Can build projects using Script Canvas and Lua, without needing a C++ compiler,  using the O3DE installer version.  
* Many optimizations for memory usage on mobile and AR/VR devices  
* Mobile performance \- up to 400% improvement across iOS, Android and AR/VR/XR devices  
* Split PhysX 4 and 5 into separate gems, enabling users to switch between the PhysX versions easily, even when using installer builds.  
* Added a Project Export UI along wth full export support for iOS, Android, Linux, and Windows. Users are no longer required to use a command line.  
* Added options to reduce size of headless server up to 90%, dependent on assets used.   
* Added a mobile specific rendering pipeline, allowing users to easily enable/disable features as needed.  
* Added ability to control quality settings per device. There is a default of 3 performance levels (low, medium, high) based on device specifications for CPU, GPU, and memory.  
* Added shader variants. When setup, this allows the renderer to automatically utilize the most performant shader for a given rendering need.   
* Added Entity Silhouette Feature

## Rendering Specific Changes for 24.09.0 Release

**Mobile Render Pipeline \-** Add support for an extremely performant mobile render pipeline built for tiled GPUs.

* Optimised BRDF for mobile \- Added a new optimised BRDF for mobile as well as support for analytical Env IBL approximation.  
* Added Gobo (i.e texture projection) support for simple spot light.
* Added CPU culling for decals
* Added shadow support for SimpleSpotLights
* Added support for decal color and decal color factor to help modulate final calculated decal color.
* Added shader options for simple point/spot lights and decals
* Added support for cpu culling for simple-point and simple-punctual lights
* Added support for deferred fog within the mobile pipeline.  
* Added exponential and exponential squared fog modes.   
* Added support for shader options within PCF filtering for directional light shadows
* Added Silhouette support to the mobile render pipeline. For more details about the Silhouette feature see the section about Rendering additions.  
* Added particles support to the mobile render pipeline.  
* Added support for postFX effects within the pipeline  
* Various half float optimizations for the mobile render pipeline.  
* Render scale related support and fixes across various mobile devices.


**Rendering additions/improvements \-** Various rendering improvements for all the render pipelines and general Atom improvements.

* Initial scaffolding for Multi-GPU support within RHI and RPI layers of the engine. A lot of this work includes initial plumbing for Multi-GPU objects and initial support for basic GPU-GPU synchronisation when transferring resources between devices.  
* Silhouette Feature \- Add support for Silhouette material type that, when applied to a mesh, draws an outline and filled-in silhouette in various modes: Always, XRay, Visible and Never.  
* Added vertex colour support  to BasePBR, StandardPBR, EnhancedPBR material types as well as material canvas.  
* Added three new tone-mapping modes: AcesFitted, AcesFilmic and Filmic. Mobile render pipeline defaults to Filmic mode.  
* Added android and ios registry settings for four tiers (low, medium, high, very high) of graphics quality.  
* Added support for geometry shader within DX12 and Vulkan RHI backends.  
* Added support for intersection shaders within DX12 and Vulkan RHI backends.
* Shadow culling outside view frustum \- Improve performance by skipping unnecessary work for all shadows that won't be visible. This is achieved by cpu culling of lights to limit the amount of lights that require processing.  
* r\_antiAliasing \- Add support to switch anti-aliasing modes via CVar r\_antiAliasing  
* Add support for lighting channels \- This feature introduces 3 channels for each kind of light and light-able objects. The objects and lights in the same channel are grouped and as a result the lights in the group affect the objects in the same group. The default behaviour is all lights and objects in channel 0, so it should not change the current way to work with lighting, but it will provide a further option to grant the artists the flexibility to control which light shines on which objects.  
* Enable and disable ContrastAdaptiveSharpening pass as well along with temporal anti aliasing (i.e TAA).  
* Added support to allow passing customised derivatives to texture sampling functions.  
* Added device attribute for the GPU model. This allows us to provide better device filtering for graphics quality tiers.  
* Added per mesh shader option support when mesh instancing is enabled. This allows us to build optimised shader variants for a scene with mesh instancing.  
* Added support for timeline semaphores within Vulkan RHI to help with low level synchronisation.  
* Added ability to disable creating a native window for game launchers for null renderers.

**Atom (O3DE renderer) Memory optimizations**

* Added support to dump information about loaded assets.  
* Various Metal RHI related memory optimizations.  
* Added support to release BufferAssets owned by ModelAssets. This allows us to release mesh related memory on the cpu once it is transferred to the gpu.  
* Ring buffer support for RayTracing buffers.

## VR/OpenXR Improvements for 24.09.0 Release.

**Improvements**

* \[OpenXR\] New data driven APIs (Lua and C++) to manage Actions (I/O) and Spaces (world transform anchors) across all OpenXR Compatible Hardware.  
* \[Android \+ OpenXR\] New Android Project Generator UI, integrated into the ProjectManager. Facilitates the generation of all the files required to compile and deploy a project on Android. Optionally, the Android project can be generated for Meta Quest  family of devices. Developer iteration times, on device, improved from \~1m:30s to less than 10s.

**Fixes**

* Many crash fixes for Quest devices  
* \[OpenXR\] MSAA resolve can be done directly into the Swapchain attachment. 

## Known Issues

* Audio WWise Not Working Until Removing and Re-Adding Gem
* Enabling PhysX 4 and PhysX 5 will result in an editor crash. Please note that the ROS2 gem automatically enables PhysX 5, please make sure PhysX 4 is disabled before enabling the ROS2 gem.
* On first load of a project, the asset processor, by default, will use all available CPU cores resulting in large memory usage. This can lead to an initial performance drop in the editor for large projects, until the assets are processed. This is particularly noticeable on Linux. If this is an issue it is advised to wait until the assets are processed.

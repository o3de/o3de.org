# O3DE 25.05.0 Release Notes

Open 3D Engine (O3DE) continues its forward momentum with a new set of updates focused on stability, performance, and overall user experience. As part of these improvements, Trackview has been comprehensively overhauled—thanks to contributions from Tech-Round—and is now fully operational within the O3DE ecosystem. Additionally, performance and usability enhancements to the Atom renderer have been delivered through the leadership of AWS and Huawei.  
For simulation, O3DE now implements the newly standardized simulation interfaces for ROS 2\. This interface standard is a joint endeavor between Open Robotics, Nvidia, and Open 3D Foundation via [Robotec.ai](http://robotec.ai/), to be implemented in upcoming releases of Open 3D Engine, Isaac Sim and Gazebo. (specs: [https://github.com/ros-simulation/simulation\_interfaces](https://github.com/ros-simulation/simulation_interfaces)). Meta has also streamlined the setup process for its Meta Quest Mobile SDK within O3DE. With package management now handled automatically by the 3rdparty packaging system, manual installation steps have been eliminated, improving developer workflow. More than 250 bugs were resolved for this release.

# Sig-Graphics-audio

## Major features

* **Mature MGPU support**  
  * Major refactor of RHI MultiDeviceObject  
  * Multi-device masks for Images and Buffers  
  * CopyPass support for MGPU  
  * Fix Scope linkage for Scopes running on different devices  
  * Implicitly multi-device RayTracingAccelerationStructurePass  
  * Support inheriting device index from parent pass   
  * Improve frame graph when multi-device features are used  
  * Multi-device support for the BRDF texture generation  
  * Handle multiGPU Passes in ImGui Timestamp View  
  * Improve CopyPass to support device index for queries  
  * Calibrated Timestamps for multi-device timestamp comparability  
* **SubPass support** (40% bandwidth optimization)  
  * Added Subpass support to the RPI as designed here: [https://github.com/o3de/sig-graphics-audio/blob/main/rfcs/SubpassesSupportInRPI/RFC\_SubpassesSupportInRPI.md](https://github.com/o3de/sig-graphics-audio/blob/main/rfcs/SubpassesSupportInRPI/RFC_SubpassesSupportInRPI.md)  
  * Refactor Vulkan RenderPassBuilder to use a RenderAttachmentLayout  
  * Enable specialization constants for all RHI on all platforms  
  * Add support for subpasses to Vulkan and Metal  
* **Function/Specialization shader constants** - Added support for specialization constants for shader options. When using specialization constants there's no need to create a shader variant, the values for shader options are baked at runtime. Also added batching of shader variants as part of the work for using specialization constants. Supported on DX12, Vulkan and Metal.  
* **GeometryView** - Introduced a new class called GeometryView that helps to de-duplicate data between drawItems and drawPackets, as these now hold a pointer to the respective GeometryView, making both DrawPackets and DrawItems smaller in size and thus more cache friendly. Most importantly, it allows index and stream buffers and buffer views to be modified at runtime without having to rebuild DrawPackets/DrawItems.   
* **Vertex color support** - Added vertex color support to the BasePBR, StandardPBR and EnhancedPBR materials. Vertex color can be combined with the base color using a factor and a blending method that can be configured in the material. Vertex color can be enable/disable from the material

* Improved the installation process for the Meta Quest Mobile SDK for O3DE. Installation is automatic now.

# Sig-docs-community

* Docs now make use of Hugo’s module system for the API docs, as part of the initiative to make docs easier to contribute to. Gone are the days of giant PRs in the o3de.org repository to update the API docs.  
* To that end, there have been some changes to the API docs generation process. Core contributors take note of the documentation for the new process in the sig-docs repo.  
* SIG-Simulation’s new work includes documentation updates for it. 🥳

# Known Issues in 25.05

* Some incompatibility with Clang 19 (or greater) has been reported. It is suggested to use at most Clang 18\. In case your distro is providing a greater version, you can always install an additional suggested version with the following steps: workaround is to downgrade the compiler when installing the engine:  
1. Install the latest compatible version of Clang (e.g. apt install clang-18).  
2. When the engine solution is generated (see *Step 3* at [official docs page](https://docs.o3de.org/docs/welcome-guide/setup/setup-from-github/building-linux)), append the desired compiler version:  
   ```bash
   cmake -B build/linux -S . -G "Ninja Multi-Config" \
   -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=clang-18 -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=clang++-18  
   ```
* Lua Editor \- Set breakpoints works only when script tab is focused \- [https://github.com/o3de/o3de/issues/18856](https://github.com/o3de/o3de/issues/18856)  
* New project with console errors and warnings \- [https://github.com/o3de/o3de/issues/18861](https://github.com/o3de/o3de/issues/18861)   

# Upcoming Impactful Changes

## Change to material-shaders (scheduled for 25.10.0 release in October 2025)

We are going to introduce several breaking changes to the materials for the 25.10.0 release, expected in October, which will impact material-shaders quite significantly. The first change, [PR 18392](https://github.com/o3de/o3de/pull/18392), encapsulates the material shader parameters into a struct MaterialParameters.

Functions used by the built-in material-types (StandardPBR, BasePBR, etc.) will get an extra parameter, e.g.:  
`VsOutput EvaluateVertexGeometry(VsInput IN, VsSystemValues SV);`

turns into  
`VsOutput EvaluateVertexGeometry(VsInput IN, VsSystemValues SV, const MaterialParameters params)`

and well as several subsequent functions as well. 

Material parameter access now happens with that struct, e.g.   
`float2 baseColorUv \= uvs\[MaterialSrg::m\_baseColorMapUvIndex\];`

will be   
`float2 baseColorUv \= uvs\[params.m\_baseColorMapUvIndex\];`

The struct cannot hold textures or samplers, so we had to replace these with indices and provide functions to fetch them (from the bindless SRG if supported, or from an fixed size array in the MaterialSrg), e.g.

`real3 sampledColor \= GetBaseColorInput(MaterialSrg::m\_baseColorMap, MaterialSrg::m\_sampler, baseColorUv, real3(MaterialSrg::m\_baseColor.rgb), o\_baseColor\_useTexture, uvDxDy, customDerivatives);`

turns into   
`real3 sampledColor \= GetBaseColorInput(GetMaterialTexture(params.m\_baseColorMap), GetMaterialTextureSampler(), baseColorUv, real3(params.m\_baseColor.rgb), o\_baseColor\_useTexture, uvDxDy, customDerivatives);`

If you are using the provided material types, this should have no impact beyond asset reprocessing.   
**MaterialCanvas** \- material shaders need to be regenerated, which happens when you open these materials with the MaterialCanvas editor.

## Change ray tracing RHI descriptors to declarative style (scheduled for 25.10.0 release in October 2025)

[PR18913](https://github.com/o3de/o3de/pull/18913) changes the declaration of the following ray-tracing related classes (and single-device counterparts):
`AZ::RHI::RayTracingBlasDescriptor`,
`AZ::RHI::RayTracingTlasDescriptor`,
`AZ::RHI::RayTracingPipelineStateDescriptor`,
`AZ::RHI::RayTracingShaderTableDescriptor`,
from a builder pattern to a declarative pattern.

Code which uses these ray tracing RHI functions directly needs to be updated to use the new structs.

A potential change could look as follows (eg. DiffuseProbeGridRayTracingPass, a custom ray tracing pass which separate from AZ::Render::RayTracingPass), old version:
```cpp
RHI::RayTracingPipelineStateDescriptor descriptor;
descriptor.Build()
    ->PipelineState(m_globalPipelineState.get())
    ->MaxPayloadSize(96)
    ->MaxAttributeSize(32)
    ->MaxRecursionDepth(MaxRecursionDepth)
    ->ShaderLibrary(rayGenerationShaderDescriptor)
        ->RayGenerationShaderName(AZ::Name("RayGen"))
    ->ShaderLibrary(missShaderDescriptor)
        ->MissShaderName(AZ::Name("Miss"))
    ->ShaderLibrary(closestHitShaderDescriptor)
        ->ClosestHitShaderName(AZ::Name("ClosestHit"))
    ->HitGroup(AZ::Name("HitGroup"))
        ->ClosestHitShaderName(AZ::Name("ClosestHit"))
;
```

New version:
```cpp
RHI::RayTracingPipelineStateDescriptor descriptor;
descriptor.m_pipelineState = m_globalPipelineState.get();
descriptor.m_configuration.m_maxPayloadSize = 96;
descriptor.m_configuration.m_maxAttributeSize = 32;
descriptor.m_configuration.m_maxRecursionDepth = MaxRecursionDepth;

descriptor.AddRayGenerationShaderLibrary(rayGenerationShaderDescriptor, Name("RayGen"));
descriptor.AddMissShaderLibrary(missShaderDescriptor, Name("Miss"));
descriptor.AddClosestHitShaderLibrary(closestHitShaderDescriptor, Name("ClosestHit"));

descriptor.AddHitGroup(Name("HitGroup"), Name("ClosestHit"));
```

**Open 3D Engine (O3DE)** 23.10 release levels up the authoring experience for game creators and robotics simulation developers. In addition to improvements to the core engine, robotics users in O3DE now have an updated ROS2 Gem, a Gem that provides integration with the [Robot Operating System (ROS2)](https://www.ros.org/), which provides drivers, state-of-the-art algorithms, and developer tools for robotics simulations.

## Highlights

Here are some highlights of O3DE 23.10, followed by a detailed list of features broken down by Special Interest Group (SIG).

1. New and Improved Authoring Experiences: Added compact nodes to Script Canvas. These are nodes that handle simple operations and utilize less visual space, making for a more compact and easier to debug graph. 

2. New Document Property Editor (experimental): Default Disabled, The Document Property Editor (DPE) is a new framework that allows tool creators to write editors without having to dive into the complexities inherent in Qt-based UI, element sorting, or user-driven filtering. The DPE allows developers to specify the layout, editing behavior, and general properties of a user interface in an XML-like "document", which the DocumentPropertyEditor widget interprets to create the desired user experience. O3DE's "Console Variables" editor is the first tool to be written using the DPE framework, with experimental support for a DPE-based Entity Inspector debuting in this release, capable of visualizing prefab overrides. How to enable: https://docs.o3de.org/docs/learning-guide/tutorials/entities-and-prefabs/override-a-prefab/#prefab-overrides-in-entity-inspector

3. New Prefab Overrides (experimental): Default disabled, requires DPE to be enabled. Added support for prefab overrides in the new Document Property Editor (DPE) inspector. Prefab overrides are now visible as blue dots in the inspector. Users can see and manipulate overrides on entities at property and component levels. (RFC: https://github.com/o3de/sig-content/issues/112) How to enable: (https://docs.o3de.org/docs/learning-guide/tutorials/entities-and-prefabs/override-a-prefab/#prefab-overrides-in-entity-inspector)

4. Installation and Gem Improvements: Automation to create remote object repos (gems, templates, and projects), making it easier than ever for users to access other users content in O3DE. Linux Snap packages for both Ubuntu 20.04 and 22.04 support, making it easier to install an already compiled version of O3DE on Linux. Many fixes to the installation and setup experience for Linux when utilizing Debian, Snap, or GitHub installation. 

5. Improved ability to export projects created with O3DE for Windows, Linux, Linux Server, and iOS, making it easier to distribute apps privately and publicly. Android project exporting coming soon. Documentation https://development--o3deorg.netlify.app/docs/user-guide/packaging/project-export/ 

6. Many visual and performance improvements to Atom (O3DE graphics and rendering system) including the start of mobile support for iOS/Android. 

7. Enhanced Robotics Features: Substantial improvements to robotic Project Templates. Manipulation template has been added to enable quick start with robotic arms. Templates now also include mini-tutorials that help to guide users through running them with Robot Operating System 2 (ROS 2) packages. Robotic manipulation components have been redesigned for modularity. Added support for prismatic joints. Camera sensor component has improved performance, configurability, and supports adding of noise. Two grippers are now available, finger gripper and vacuum gripper. Added Contact sensor component.

### sig-simulation


**Robotics gems (o3de/o3de-extras):**
Over 100 PRs merged in total for 23.10.
* **Summary of changes:**
     - Substantial improvements to robotic Project Templates. Manipulation template has been added to enable quick start with robotic arms. Templates now also include mini-tutorials that help to guide users through running them with Robot Operating System 2 (ROS 2) packages, for example https://github.com/o3de/o3de-extras/pull/450.
     - Robotic manipulation components have been redesigned for modularity, have plenty of extra features such as state, error and feedback publishing, and better handling overall for the FollowJointTrajectory action server. Any joint system can be simulated now, and components work with articulations as well as classic joints. These manipulation components now support prismatic joints as well.
     - Two grippers are now available, finger gripper and vacuum gripper. They can be controlled through ROS action server. 
     - Robot Import feature was significantly improved and expanded to include a degree of support for **SDFormat** along with URDF. Plugins are now handled during the import and converted to O3DE components such as sensors and robot control.
     - Camera sensor component has improved performance, configurability, and supports adding of noise.
     - Lidar sensor simulation is more modular now, enabling easier change of data acquisition methods (implementations) and sensor models. For example, point clouds can be optionally published in the raycaster to save extra copy, which is used in the RGL Gem. 
     - Contact sensor component has been added (a new sensor).
     - Update of the sensor system abstraction, including support for high-frequency data acquisition through simulation events. It is now easier for developers to add a new kind of sensor.
     - Better implementations for Inertial Measurement Unit and Wheel Odometry sensors.
     - [Warehouse Automation Gem](https://github.com/o3de/o3de-extras/tree/development/Gems/WarehouseAutomation), a new Gem including assets and components for elements such as conveyor belt, proximity sensor, pallets, etc.
     - Numerous bug fixes, improvements to UX and developer interfaces such as component buses for ROS 2 Gem components.

After installing Open 3D Engine (O3DE), you're ready to create your first O3DE project. Projects define and configure the set of code and assets that make up your game or other application. Projects need a project directory, which can be located anywhere that is convenient to you - within the O3DE directory itself, somewhere else on your computer, or even on a network drive.

## Creating a Project

O3DE projects are created from the `o3de` tool and the CMake scripts included with O3DE. Typically, to get you started with a common set of features, it's easiest to create your project using the default template that comes with O3DE. This project template specifies a set of Gems that enable these features. Later on, you will learn how to create your own custom project templates.

The topics in this section introduce you to creating O3DE projects.

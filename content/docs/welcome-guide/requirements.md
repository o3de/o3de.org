**Open 3D Engine (O3DE)** has a minimum set of hardware and software requirements for development, as outlined in the following sections. In the [Software prerequisites and configuration](#software-prerequisites) section, each prerequisite is listed along with any specific configuration steps required.

## Hardware requirements

The following sections specify the minimum and recommended system hardware required to install or build **O3DE Editor** and related tools, and to develop O3DE projects.  RAM and free disk space requirements are dependent on the options that you select when configuring your project in O3DE.  Performance will vary based on the complexity of your project's levels.  

{{< note >}}
Building the engine from source requires 2GB _per thread_ in addition to your system's running requirements.  However, it is possible to limit the number of threads that are allocated to the build process.  

Installing the engine with the [pre-built installer](https://o3debinaries.org/download/windows.html) requires less disk space and RAM than building from source.

## Software prerequisites and configuration {#software-prerequisites}

Creating new projects or using the advanced development features of O3DE requires several software components depending on the operating system you are using. 

## Microsoft Windows

At this time, Microsoft Windows is the primary platform for using the O3DE
editor and for building source. Specifically, **Windows 10 version 20H2 (10.0.19042)**
or later is required.

### Microsoft Visual Studio

The following versions of Visual Studio are supported:

+ [Microsoft Visual Studio 2019](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/releases/2019/release-notes) version **16.11.x**.
+ [Microsoft Visual Studio 2022](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/releases/2022/release-notes) version **17.3.x**.

You can use any Microsoft Visual Studio license, including the Community edition.

In addition, **Windows 10 SDK** version at **10.0.19041.0** or later is required.

#### Visual Studio configuration

The default Visual Studio installation might not include all of the features that are required by O3DE. The following steps describe how to ensure that the necessary Visual Studio features are enabled:

1. Launch the **Visual Studio Installer**.

1. Choose **Modify** on the version of Visual Studio that you'll use with O3DE.
   {{< note >}}
   Make sure you are modifying an installation of Visual Studio [Community, Enterprise, Professional] and not a different product, such as Visual Studio Build Tools.
   {{< /note >}}

1. On the **Workloads** tab:
   + Select **Game development with C++**.
      + In the **Installation details** panel on the right, select a **Windows 10 SDK** version at **10.0.19041.0** or later.
   + Select **Desktop development with C++**.

1. Once you've completed your changes, choose the **Install** button in the lower right hand corner, selecting your preferred download option.
  {{< note >}}
  If you've made changes to an existing installation, you might see a **Modify** button in the lower right corner of the options window instead.
  {{< /note >}}

After the install completes, you might be prompted to restart your system.

### Microsoft Visual Studio C++ Redistributable

You will also need the latest version of [Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/#other-family), if it was not installed by the **Desktop development with C++** workload for Visual Studio. 

After installing the C++ redistributable, you might be prompted to restart your system.

### CMake

[CMake {{< versions/cmake >}} or later](https://cmake.org/download/#latest) is required to configure and build O3DE projects. We strongly recommend that you install the **Latest Release** from the CMake download page instead of a Release Candidate. During installation, select one of the options that adds CMake to the system PATH. This will save you from having to do this later.

   ![Add CMake to the system PATH during installation](/images/welcome-guide/requirements-cmake-install-add-to-path.png)

#### CMake configuration validation

Several O3DE CLI scripts require the `cmake.exe` command line tool to be available from a command line window. To see if this tool is on the system path, open a command prompt and use the `--version` command.

```cmd
cmake --version
```

If the current CMake version was not returned because CMake cannot be found, locate the `bin` folder in the CMake installation directory and add the path to that folder to the front of your Windows system `PATH` environment variable by doing the following:

1. Open the Windows Start menu.

1. Type "env" to search for environment variables. Choose **Edit system environment variables**.

1. Choose the **Environment Variables** button.

1. Select **Path** under **System variables**.

1. Choose the **Edit...** button.

1. Choose **New** to add a new path to the list and enter the full path to the CMake `bin` folder.

   ![Manually add CMake to the system PATH](/images/welcome-guide/requirements-cmake-add-to-path-manually.png)

1. (Recommended) Choose **Move Up** to move the path to the top of the list.

1. Choose **OK** to save your changes and close the windows that were opened.

1. Verify that `cmake` is on the system path by opening a new command line window and running `cmake --version` again.

## Linux

The primary Linux distribution for using the O3DE Editor is Ubuntu {{< versions/ubuntu >}}.

{{< note >}}
Support for Ubuntu 24.04 LTS and Ubuntu on 64-bit ARMv8 processors is in an experimental stage.
{{< /note >}}

The following instructions describe how to retrieve and install the required software packages through Ubuntu's `apt` command-line utility.

### CMake {#linux-cmake}

As with the other operating systems, [CMake {{< versions/cmake >}} or later](https://cmake.org/download/#latest) is required to configure and build O3DE projects. We strongly recommend that you install the **Latest Release** of CMake rather than the default one provided by your current Linux distribution. If CMake is already installed, but does not match the minimum version, you will need to remove it with the following command.

```shell
sudo apt remove cmake
```

Install CMake using the instructions for the version of Ubuntu that you have installed:

{{< tabs name="CMake install" >}}
{{% tab name="22.04 LTS" %}}

You can install the default version of CMake for Ubuntu 22.04 LTS, which is version 3.22. To install more recent versions, refer to the CMake [download page](https://cmake.org/download/#latest).

```shell
sudo apt install cmake
```

{{% /tab %}}
{{% tab name="24.04 LTS" %}}

You can install the default version of CMake for Ubuntu 24.04 LTS, which is version 3.28. To install more recent versions, refer to the CMake [download page](https://cmake.org/download/#latest).

```shell
sudo apt install cmake
```

{{% /tab %}}
{{< /tabs >}}

Once installed, verify that the version meets the minimum version criteria.

```shell
cmake --version
```

### Clang

O3DE requires [Clang {{< versions/clang >}} or later](https://clang.llvm.org/get_started.html) and the [GNU C++ Library](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/libstdc++/) to compile all of the native C++ code.

Install Clang and the GNU C++ Library using the instructions for the version of Ubuntu that you have installed:

{{< tabs name="Clang install" >}}
{{% tab name="22.04 LTS" %}}

You can install the default version of Clang for Ubuntu 22.04 LTS, which is clang-14. You will also need to install the corresponding [GNU C++ Library](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/libstdc++/).

```shell
sudo apt install libstdc++-12-dev clang
```

{{% /tab %}}
{{% tab name="24.04 LTS" %}}

You can install the default version of Clang for Ubuntu 24.04 LTS, which is clang-18. You will also need to install the corresponding [GNU C++ Library](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/libstdc++/).

```shell
sudo apt install libstdc++-12-dev clang
```

{{% /tab %}}
{{< /tabs >}}

### Vulkan supported video drivers

In addition to the minimum hardware requirements for video cards for O3DE, Linux requires that the latest drivers for the video card are installed and enabled. Refer to the video card manufacturer's support page for instructions on how to do this.

### Additional library dependencies

O3DE also requires some additional library packages to be installed:

* libglu1-mesa-dev
* libxcb-randr0-dev
* libxcb-xinerama0
* libxcb-xinput0
* libxcb-xinput-dev
* libxcb-xfixes0-dev
* libxcb-xkb-dev
* libxkbcommon-dev
* libxkbcommon-x11-dev
* libfontconfig1-dev
* libpcre2-16-0
* zlib1g-dev
* mesa-common-dev
* libstdc++-12-dev
* libunwind-dev
* libzstd-dev
* tix

You can download and install these packages through `apt`.

```shell
sudo apt install libglu1-mesa-dev libxcb-randr0-dev libxcb-xinerama0 libxcb-xinput0 libxcb-xinput-dev libxcb-xfixes0-dev libxcb-xkb-dev libxkbcommon-dev libxkbcommon-x11-dev libfontconfig1-dev libpcre2-16-0 zlib1g-dev mesa-common-dev libunwind-dev libzstd-dev tix
```

### Ninja Build System (Optional)

By default, CMake uses Unix Makefiles for building O3DE. O3DE supports multiple build configurations (debug, profile, and release), which you specify when building O3DE. Unix Makefiles only supports single-configuration builds, so you must determine which configuration you want to build when you generate the project. All project builds are based on that configuration. In order to change the build configuration, you need to regenerate the project with the different configuration. This process restricts O3DE's support for multiple-configuration builds and slows down building workflows.

The Ninja build system is an alternative to Linux's default Unix Makefiles. The Ninja build system makes it easier to generate, configure, and build your project. With the Ninja build system, specifically [Ninja Multi-Config](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/generator/Ninja%20Multi-Config.html), you can generate the project once and determine which configuration to build during build time. We recommend that you use this generator for O3DE development. You can install the Ninja build tool through `apt`.

```shell
sudo apt install ninja-build
```

## macOS

Support for developing on macOS is in an experimental stage. At a minimum, you need macOS Big Sur, Intel x86_64, XCode {{< versions/xcode >}} or later, and a Metal-compatible video card that meets the hardware requirements above.

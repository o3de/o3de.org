In this tutorial, you'll learn how to extend the **Open 3D Engine (O3DE) Editor** using the `PythonToolGem` template to create a custom tool Gem called **MyPyShapeExample**. This custom tool allows you to create entities with a Shape component and configure their component properties. The Gem is written in Python with [Qt](https://wiki.qt.io/Main), the O3DE Tools UI API, and other O3DE APIs.

The **PyShapeExample** Gem, a sample Gem in the [`o3de/sample-code-gems` repository](https://github.com/o3de/sample-code-gems/tree/main/py_gems/PyShapeExample), demonstrates the finished Gem that you create in this tutorial. You can reference the PyShapeExample Gem sample as you follow along this tutorial.

By the end of this tutorial, you'll be able to extend the Editor by creating your own custom tools written in Python.

The following image is a preview of the custom tool that you create.

{{< image-width "/images/learning-guide/tutorials/extend-the-editor/shape-example/python-shape-example-demo.png" "1080" "An image of the Shape Example tool and some entities created by it." >}}


## Prerequisites

Before you start the tutorial, ensure that you have the following:

- Set up an O3DE development environment. For instructions, refer to [Set up Open 3D Engine](/docs/welcome-guide/setup/).


## Tutorial specifics

This tutorial uses the following Windows directory names and locations in the examples. You may choose different folder names and locations on your disk.

- **O3DE engine directory**: `C:\o3de`  
    The source directory that contains the engine.

- **`PythonToolGem` template**: `C:\o3de\Templates\PythonToolGem`  
    The Gem template that your custom Gem is based off of.

- **MyPyShapeExample Gem**: `C:\o3de-gems\MyPyShapeExample`  
    Your custom Gem. You may choose a different folder name and location in disk.

## Create a Gem from the `PythonToolGem` template

Start by creating a Gem from the `PythonToolGem` template, which contains a basic Python framework to create a dialog window that extends the Editor.

To create a Gem based on the `PythonToolGem` template, complete the following steps: 

1. Create a Gem by using the **O3DE CLI** (`o3de`) script that's in your engine directory. 

    ```cmd
    scripts\o3de create-gem --gem-name MyPyShapeExample --gem-path C:\o3de-gems\MyPyShapeExample --template-name PythonToolGem
    ```

    The command specifies the following options: 
    - `--gem-name`, `-gn`: The name of the new Gem. 
    - `--gem-path`, `-gp`: The path to create the new Gem at. 
    - `--template-name`, `-tn`: The path to the template that you want to create the new Gem from.

    This Gem is based off of the `PythonToolGem` template. In this example, name the Gem `MyPyShapeExample` and create it in `C:\o3de-gems\MyPyShapeExample`.

   Depending on the Gem path, this command automatically registers the Gem to one of the manifest files: `.o3de\o3de_manifest.json`, `<engine>\engine.json`, and `<project>\project.json`.

2. (Optional) Register the Gem to your project. This step is optional because when you create a Gem using the O3DE CLI in the previous step, it automatically registers the Gem.

    ```cmd
    scripts\o3de register -gp C:\o3de-gems\MyPyShapeExample -espp <project-path>
    ```

3. Add the Gem in your project by using the `o3de` script.

    ```cmd
    scripts\o3de enable-gem -gn MyPyShapeExample -pp <project-path>
    ```

    Or, enable the Gem using the Project Manager (refer to [Adding and Removing Gems in a Project](/docs/user-guide/project-config/add-remove-gems.md)).

4. Build the project by using the `o3de` script (refer to [Build a project](/docs/user-guide/build/configure-and-build/#build-a-project)). Or, use the Project Manager (refer to the **Build** action in the [Project Manager](/docs/user-guide/project-config/project-manager/)) page.

5. Open Editor for your project.

6. Open the tool by selecting **Tools > Examples > MyPyShapeExample** from the file menu. (See A in the following image.)

    Or, open the tool directly by clicking on the tool's icon in the **Edit Mode Toolbar**. (See B.)

Now you can access the Shape Example tool! By default, this tool contains a simple user interface (UI). In the next steps, we'll design the tool's UI and code its functionality. (See C.)

## Code directory

This sections describes your MyPyShapeExample Gem's code structure. It's important to become familiar with your Gem's code structure because this is the entry point where you will program your tool's custom functionality. In this example, your Gem's directory is located at: `C:\o3de-gems\MyPyShapeExample`. This is the path that you specified when you created the Gem. Your Gem's code is located in the subdirectories `Code\Source` and `Editor\Scripts`, which contains the following classes and frameworks that make up your custom tool.

Example of `Code\Source` directory:

{{< image-width "/images/learning-guide/tutorials/extend-the-editor/shape-example/python-tool-gem-template-directory.png" "720" "Editor with a tool created using the PythonToolGem template." >}}

Example of `Editor\Scripts` directory:

{{< image-width "/images/learning-guide/tutorials/extend-the-editor/shape-example/python-tool-gem-template-directory-2.png" "620" "Editor with a tool created using the PythonToolGem template." >}}

### Modules and system components

All Gems have modules and system component classes written in C++ that connect the tool to O3DE and allow it to communicate with other systems. The `PythonToolGem` template already contains all of the code needed to run the tool in the Editor. You can find these C++ files in `Code\Source`.

For more information on Gem modules and system components, refer to the [Overview of the Open 3D Engine Gem Module system](/docs/user-guide/programming/gems/overview/) page.

### O3DE and Qt frameworks

O3DE extends the **Qt** framework, so you will use [PySide2](https://pypi.org/project/PySide2/)---the Python bindings for Qt, [Qt for Python](https://doc.qt.io/qtforpython/)---to create a graphical user interface (GUI). You will also use O3DE's EBuses to communicate with other O3DE interfaces, such as entities and components, and connect them to Qt elements.

You will write most of your tool's functionality and UI elements in the`PyShapeExampleDialog` class that's located in `Editor\Scripts\pyshapeexample_dialog.py`.

### Qt Resources

The [Qt Resource System](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/resources.html) allows Gems to store and load image files via a `.qrc` file. This eliminates the need to load image files from absolute paths, making it simpler for you to distribute your Gem. Later, you will store an image file to create an icon for your tool.

## Dependent modules

Import the following dependent modules in the `Editor\Scripts\pyshapeexample_dialog.py` file. The `PyShapeExampleDialog` class that you will create uses objects from these modules. 

```py
import azlmbr.bus as bus
import azlmbr.components as components
import azlmbr.editor as editor
import azlmbr.entity as entity
import azlmbr.math as math

from PySide2.QtCore import Qt
from PySide2.QtGui import QDoubleValidator
from PySide2.QtWidgets import QCheckBox, QComboBox, QDialog, QFormLayout, QGridLayout, QGroupBox, QLabel, QLineEdit, QPushButton, QVBoxLayout, QWidget
```

## Dialogs, Widgets, and layouts

With Qt for Python, you can create a *dialogs*, or top-level windows. Within a dialog are *widgets*, which are containers for UI elements, and *layouts*, which define how those UI elements are arranged. (In comparison, Qt in C++ creates a main widget instead of a dialog.) You custom tool is a dialog that constains sub-widgets of UI elements. Each widget can have its own layout and additional sub-widgets. The nested widget and layout structure allows you to organize groups of UI elements.

The `PyShapeExampleDialog` class inherits from `QDialog`, which creates the dialog window. The following instructions walk you through how to set up your dialog's layout. Be aware that some of the instructions may already be done by the `PythonToolGem` template.

1. At the top of your constructor, instantiate a `QVBoxLayout` called `main_layout`.

2. Later, you will create various UI elements and add them to `main_layout`.

3. (Optional) You can add spacing to `main_layout` by using `setSpacing(...)`.

4. We recommend that you add a stretch at the bottom of `main_layout` by using `addStretch()` to fill any expanded space when you resize the window.

5. Finally, set `main_layout` to be the layout for this dialog by using `self.setLayout(...)`.

```py
class PyShapeExampleDialog(QDialog):
    
    def __init__(self, parent=None):

        main_layout = QVBoxLayout()
        main_layout.setSpacing(20)

        // Add various UI elements to main_layout

        main_layout.addStretch()

        self.setLayout(main_layout)
```


## Input fields and checkboxes

In this step, create an input field for the entity's name and a checkbox for an option to append a suffix---the component's name---to the entity's name. For example, suppose you set the entity's name to "MyEntity" and enable the checkbox. Then, when you create an entity with a **Box Shape** component and another with a **Sphere Shape** component, they will respectively be named "MyEntity_BoxShape" and "MyEntity_SphereShape".

By the end of this step, your input field and checkbox should look like this:

{{< image-width "/images/learning-guide/tutorials/extend-the-editor/shape-example/input-field-check-box.png" "500" "Shows UI for an input field and checkbox" >}}

After instantiating `mainLayout`, wrap these UI elements in their own sub-widget, set the layout, and add it to the main widget. 

1. To start, instantiate a `QGroupBox` called `entity_name_widget` and a `QFormLayout` called `form_layout`.

2. Later, you will create the input field and checkbox and add them to this widget. 

3. Finally, set the layout of `entity_name_widget` to `form_layout`, and add `entity_name_widget` to `main_layout`.

```py
        entity_name_widget = QGroupBox("Name your entity (Line Edit)", self)    # 1
        form_layout = QFormLayout()

        # ...                                                                   # 2

        entity_name_widget.setLayout(form_layout)                               # 3
        main_layout.addWidget(entity_name_widget)
```

### Create an input field

An input field takes text input from the user. With Qt, you can create an input field by using the `QLineEdit` object. In this example, the input field is used to name the generated entity. You will define this behavior later.

1. Create an input field by instantiating `QLineEdit`. In this example, name it `name_input`.

2. Set the placeholder text in `name_input` by calling `setPlaceholderText(...)`.

3. Enable a button to clear the text using `setClearButtonEnabled(True)`.

```py
        self.name_input = QLineEdit(self)
        self.name_input.setPlaceholderText("Optional")
        self.name_input.setClearButtonEnabled(True)
```

### Create a checkbox

A checkbox is an option button that users can enable or disable to trigger a user-defined behavior. With Qt, you can create an checkbox by using the `QCheckBox` object. In this example, the checkbox controls whether or not to append a suffix to the entity's name. At runtime, it will start disabled, and enable when the user enters the entity's name to the input field. You will define this behavior later.

1. Create a checkbox by instantiating `QCheckBox`. In this example, name it `add_shape_name_suffix`.

2. Set the checkbox to start in the disabled state by using `setDisabled(True)`.

```py
        self.add_shape_name_suffix = QCheckBox(self)
        self.add_shape_name_suffix.setDisabled(True)
        self.add_shape_name_suffix.setToolTip("e.g. Entity2_BoxShape")
```

### Add a signal listener with a slot handler

Qt uses signals and slots to communicate between objects (refer to [Signals & Slots](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/signalsandslots.html) in the Qt Documentation). Set up a signal listener such that when the user enters text into the input field at runtime, the checkbox automatically enables.

In this example, the signal listener uses a slot handler, which is essentially a Python function that a signal can connect to.

1. Call `connect(...)` to create a connection between the input field (`name_input`) to the signal (`textChanged`) and slot (`on_name_input_text_changed`).

    ```py
            self.name_input.textChanged.connect(self.on_name_input_text_changed)
    ```

2. Outside of the constructor, define a slot as you would for a standard Python function. In this example, name the slot `on_name_input_text_changed`.

    ```py
        def on_name_input_text_changed(self, text):

            self.add_shape_name_suffix.setEnabled(len(text))
            
    ```


### Add UI elements to layout

After creating the UI elements---an input field and a checkbox---and connecting a signal listener to them, add them to the UI. To ensure they belong to the sub-widget `entity_name_widget`, add them to `form_layout` by calling `addRow(...)`.

```py
        form_layout.addRow("Entity name", self.name_input)
        form_layout.addRow("Add shape name suffix", self.add_shape_name_suffix)
```

## Comboboxes

In this step, you will create a combobox that contains a list of values that you can use to scale the size of the entity.

By the end of this step, your combobox should look like this:

{{< image-width "/images/learning-guide/tutorials/extend-the-editor/shape-example/combo-box.png" "500" "Shows UI for combobox" >}}

First, wrap these UI elements in their own sub-widget, set the layout, and add it to the main widget. 

1. To start, instantiate a `QGroupBox` called `combobox_group` and a `QVBoxLayout` called `combobox_layout`.

2. Later, you will create a combobox and define a list of scale values.

3. Finally, set the layout of `combobox_group` to `combobox_layout`, and add `combobox_group` to `mainLayout`.

```py
        combobox_group = QGroupBox("Choose your scale (combobox)", self)   # 1
        combobox_layout = QVBoxLayout()

        # ...                                                               # 2

        combobox_group.setLayout(combobox_layout)                           # 3
        main_layout.addWidget(combobox_group)
```

### Create a combobox

A combobox allows users to select an item from a pop up list of items. With Qt, you can create an input field by using the `QComboBox` object.

1. Define a list of scale values. In this example, name it `scale_values`.

2. Create a combobox by instantiating `QComboBox`. In this example, name it `scale_combobox`. 

3. Allow users to enter a custom option in the combobox by calling `setEditable(True)`. 

4. If a user enters a custom option, validate that the value they entered is a numerical value within a specific range and decimal place by calling `setValidator(...)`. In this example, set the lower bound to `0.0`, the upper bound to `100.0`, and the decimal places to `3`. 

5. Add the list of values to the combobox by calling `addItems(...)`.

6. Add the combobox to `combobox_layout` by calling `addWidget(...)`.

```py
        scale_values = [                                                            # 1
            "1.0",
            "1.5",
            "2.0",
            "5.0",
            "10.0"
        ]
        self.scale_combobox = QComboBox(self)                                       # 2
        self.scale_combobox.setEditable(True)                                       # 3
        self.scale_combobox.setValidator(QDoubleValidator(0.0, 100.0, 3, self))     # 4
        self.scale_combobox.addItems(scale_values)                                  # 5

        combobox_layout.addWidget(self.scale_combobox)                              # 6
```


## Buttons

In this step, you will create a collection of buttons that create an entity with different Shape components, such as with a Box Shape, Sphere Shape, Cone Shape, and so on.

By the end of this step, your buttons should look like this:

{{< image-width "/images/learning-guide/tutorials/extend-the-editor/shape-example/buttons.png" "500" "Shows UI for buttons" >}}


First, wrap these UI elements in their own sub-widget, set the layout, and add it to the main widget. 

1. To start, instantiate a `QGroupBox` called `shape_buttons` and a `QGridLayout` called `grid_layout`.

2. Later, you will query for all types of shape components registered with the engine, add buttons to this widget, and add signal listeners to the buttons.

3. Finally, set the layout of `shape_buttons` to `grid_layout`, and add `shape_buttons` to `main_layout`.

```py
        shape_buttons = QGroupBox("Choose your shape (Button)", self)   # 1
        grid_layout = QGridLayout()

        # ...                                                           # 2

        shape_buttons.setLayout(grid_layout)                            # 3
        main_layout.addWidget(shape_buttons)
```

### Query Shape components

1. Query the types of Shape components that're registered with the engine. In O3DE, all components have a list of provided services that you can query from. In this example, you are looking for Shape components, which all provide "ShapeService".

   - Create a component service list called `provided_services` and add "ShapeService". 

   - Get a list of component types that provide "ShapeService". Use `editor.EditorComponentAPIBus(...)` to call `bus.Broadcast` and dispatch `FindComponentTypeIdsByService`, which takes a list of services to include (`provided_services`) and services to exclude (an empty list) and stores the component types to `typeIds`.

   ```py
           shape_service = math.Crc32_CreateCrc32("ShapeService")
           provided_services = [shape_service.value]
           type_ids = editor.EditorComponentAPIBus(bus.Broadcast, 'FindComponentTypeIdsByService', provided_services, [])
   ```

2. Query the names of the Shape components. Later, you will add these name to the buttons.

    - Get a list of component names. Use `editor.EditorComponentAPIBus(...)` to call `bus.Broadcast` and dispatch `FindComponentTypeNames`, takes the list of component types (`typeIds`) and stores the corresponsing component names to `component_names`.

    ```py
            component_names = editor.EditorComponentAPIBus(bus.Broadcast, 'FindComponentTypeNames', type_ids)
    ```

{{< note >}}
You can query a list of services that components provide by calling the component's `GetProvidedServices()` method.
{{< /note >}}


### Add buttons

A button is a UI element that the user can click to trigger a user-defined behavior. With Qt, you can create a button by using the `QPushButton` object. In this example, when the user clicks on the button, it will create an entity with a Shape component. You will define this behavior later.

Loop through the list of component names, create buttons, and add them to the `grid_layout`. For each component:

1. Create a button by instantiating `QPushButton`. In this example, name it `name_input`. Pass in `name` to add the component's name onto the button.

2. Later, you will connect `shape_button` to a signal listener.

3. Split `grid_layout` into three columns, and add the button.

```py
        max_column_count = 3                                    
        for i, name in enumerate(component_names):
            type_id = type_ids[i]

            shape_button = QPushButton(name, self)              # 1

            # ...                                               # 2

            row = i / max_column_count                          # 3
            column = i % max_column_count
            grid_layout.addWidget(shape_button, row, column)
```

### Add a signal listener with a lambda handler

Next, create a signal listener such that when the user clicks the button, an entity will be created in your scene and the corresponding Shape component will be added to that entity.

In this example, the signal listener uses a lambda handler, so you can define the function without defining a slot.

1. Declare a function `create_entity_with_shape_component` to connect to the signal listener. This function communicates with O3DE's EBuses, which you will define later.

    ```py
        def create_entity_with_shape_component(self, type_id):
    ```

2. In the loop that you created earlier, create a connection from the `clicked` signal in the `shape_button` to a lambda function. The lambda function calls `create_entity_with_shape_component(...)` and passes in the `type_id`.

    ```py
            shape_button.clicked.connect(lambda checked=False, type_id=type_id: self.create_entity_with_shape_component(type_id))
    ```

 ### Communicate with EBuses

Define `CreateEntityWithShapeComponent(...)`, which communicates with O3DE EBuses to create a new entity with a component specified by the `typeId` parameter.

1. Send a request to check if a level is loaded in the Editor by using `editor.EditorRequestBus` to call `bus.Broadcast` and dispatch `IsLevelDocumentOpen`, which will return true/false if a level has been loaded or not.
    - Attempting to create an Entity without a level loaded will cause a crash, so if a level isn't loaded, we will print a warning message and then return.

2. Send a request to create a new entity by using `editor.ToolsApplicationRequestBus` to call `bus.Broadcast` and dispatch `CreateNewEntity`, which creates a new entity and returns its `AZ::EntityId`. The new entity's `AZ::EntityId` is stored in `new_entity_id`.

3. If the user entered a name in the input field, update the entity's name.

   - Get the name of the entity by calling `text()`, and store it in `entity_name`.

   - If the user enabled the checkbox to apply a suffix of the component's name to the entity's name, query the component's name. Use `editor.EditorComponentAPIBus` to call `bus.Broadcast` and dispatch the `FindComponentTypeNames` event, which finds the component names of the provided list and stores them in `component_names`.  

   - Format the name and suffix, if any.

   - Use `editor.EditorEntityAPIBus` to call `bus.Event`  and dispatch `"SetName"` to set the name of `new_entity_id` to `entity_name`.

4. Set the entity's scale.
   
   - Get the value in the combobox by calling `currentText()`, and store it in `scale_text`.

   - Set the entity's scale by using `components.TransformBus` to call `bus.Event` and dispatch `"SetLocalUniformScale"`, which sets the scale of `new_entity_id`. Be aware that you must convert `scale_text` to a float.

5. Add a Shape component to the entity. Use `editor.EditorComponentAPIBus` to call `bus.Broadcast` and dispatch `"AddComponentsOfType"`, which adds the components from the provided list to `new_entity_id`.

```py
     def create_entity_with_shape_component(self, type_id):

        # 1
        is_level_loaded = editor.EditorRequestBus(bus.Broadcast, 'IsLevelDocumentOpen')
        if not is_level_loaded:
            print("Make sure a level is loaded before choosing your shape")
            return

        # 2
        new_entity_id = editor.ToolsApplicationRequestBus(bus.Broadcast, 'CreateNewEntity', entity.EntityId())

        # 3
        if self.name_input.text():
            entity_name = self.name_input.text()

            if self.add_shape_name_suffix.isChecked():
                component_names = editor.EditorComponentAPIBus(bus.Broadcast, 'FindComponentTypeNames', [type_id])

                shape_name = component_names[0]
                shape_name = shape_name.replace(" ", "")

                entity_name = f"{entity_name}_{shape_name}"

            editor.EditorEntityAPIBus(bus.Event, "SetName", new_entity_id, entity_name)

        # 4
        try:
            scale_text = self.scale_combobox.currentText()
            components.TransformBus(bus.Event, "SetLocalUniformScale", new_entity_id, float(scale_text))
        except:
            pass

        # 5
        editor.EditorComponentAPIBus(bus.Broadcast, "AddComponentsOfType", new_entity_id, [type_id])
```

## Icon

An icon is an image file that's used to represent your tool in the Editor. The icon appears in the Edit Mode Toolbar in the Editor (see the following image).

{{< image-width "/images/learning-guide/tutorials/extend-the-editor/shape-example/icon.png" "500" "Add an icon for your tool in the Editor" >}}

### Add an icon

The following instructions walk you through how to store the icon using the Qt Resource System and load it from your Gem module. Be aware that some of the instructions may already be done by the `PythonToolGem` template.

1. Add an image file to the `Code\Source` directory to use as your icon. In this example, the icon is named `toolbar.svg`. We recommend that your icon adheres to the guidelines in [UI development best practices](https://o3de.org/docs/tools-ui/uidev-component-development-guidelines/#ui-development-best-practices).

2. Add your icon to MyPyShapeExample Gem's resources by updating `Code\Source\ShapeExample.qrc` with your new icon's file name.

    ```xml
    <!DOCTYPE RCC><RCC version="1.0">
        <qresource prefix="/MyPyShapeExample">
            <file alias="toolbar_icon.svg">toolbar_icon.svg</file>
        </qresource>
    </RCC>
    ```

3. Register MyPyShapeExample Gem's resources to Qt Resource System by adding the following code in `Code\Source\EditorModule.cpp`. 

    - Define the function `InitShapeExampleResource()` and call `Q_INIT_RESOURCE(...)` to register the Qt resrouces listed in `ShapeExample.qrc`.

        ```cpp
        void InitShapeExampleResources()
        {
            Q_INIT_RESOURCE(ShapeExample);
        }
        ```

    - Call `InitShapeExampleResource()` in the `EditorModule` class's constructor.


## Build and test your tool

You can test your custom tool by running it from the **Python Scripts** panel in the Editor.

1. Open Editor for your project.

2. Open the Python Scripts panel by selecting **Tools > Other > Python Scripts** from the file menu.

3. Open `pyshapeexample_dialog` in the Python Scripts panel.

Congratulations! You created a custom tool Gem that's written in Python, built it, and loaded it in the Editor. Your Shape Example tool should look something like this:

{{< image-width "/images/learning-guide/tutorials/extend-the-editor/shape-example/python-shape-example-ui.png" "500" "An image of the Shape Example tool." >}}

## Download the PyShapeExample Gem sample

Now that you've completed this tutorial, you can compare your MyPyShapeExample Gem to the sample, **PyShapeExample** Gem, in [`o3de/sample-code-gems` repository](https://github.com/o3de/sample-code-gems/tree/main/cpp_gems/ShapeExample).

To download this sample and load it in the Editor:

1. Download or clone the repository. The PyShapeExample Gem is located in `<repo>\sample-code-gems\py_gems\PyShapeExample`.

    ```cmd
    git clone https://github.com/o3de/sample-code-gems.git
    ```

2. Before you can open the Shape Example tool, do the following:

   - Register your Gem.

   - Enable it in your project.

   - Rebuild your project.

   - Open the tool in the Editor.

    These steps are explained earlier in this tutorial. Refer to [Create a Gem from the `PythonToolGem` template](#create-a-gem-from-the-pythontoolgem-template).

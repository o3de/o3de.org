# Environment Probe {#component-environment-probe}

Use the **Environment Probe** component to achieve the right visual quality for a space\. Environment probes help to determine proper reflections, ambient diffuse values, particle diffuse values, and shadow colors\.

For information about how to blend environment probes to create a smooth transition, for example, from day to night, see [Blending Environment Probes](/docs/userguide/level-blending-environment-probe.md)\.

The **Environment Probe** component has the following settings:

**Visible**
Shows the light\.

**On initially**
Specify if the light is on when created\.

## General Settings {#component-environment-probe-general-settings}

See the following general settings:

**Color**
The color of the light\.

**Diffuse multiplier**
Sets the strength of the diffuse color\.

**Specular multiplier**
Sets the strength of the specular brightness\.

## Environment Probe Settings {#component-environment-probe-settings}

See the following environment probe settings:

**Area dimensions**
The width, height, and depth in meters of the environment probe's effective area\.

**Sort priority**
Priority number for probe rendering\. Lower priority numbers \(for example, **0** or **1**\) are rendered on top of the higher priority numbers \(for example, **100**\)\.

**Resolution**
Cubemap resolution in pixels that is generated by this probe\.

**Box projected**
Enables box projection\. Does not require regeneration of the cubemap\.

**Box height**
Height of the box projection\.

**Box length**
Length of the box projection\.

**Box width**
Width of the box projection\.

**Attenuation falloff**
The value that the light begins to falloff\. For example, a value or 1\.0 means the light starts to fall off at 1\.0 meter\.

## Options {#component-environment-probe-options}

See the following options:

**View distance multiplier**
Adjusts the maximum view distance\. For example, **1\.0** uses the default and **1\.1** is 10% farther than the default\.

**Minimum spec**
Minimum specification value at which the light is enabled\.

**Voxel GI mode**
Mode for light interaction with voxel global illumination \(GI\)\.

**Use VisArea**
Light is affected by visible areas\.

**Indoor only**
Light is only rendered indoors\.

**Affects this area only**
Light affects only the immediate area\.

**Volumetric fog only**
Light affects only volumetric fog\.

**Volumetric fog**
Light affects volumetric fog and surrounding area\.

## Animation {#component-environment-probe-animation}

See the following animation settings:

**Style**
Enter a number to specify a preset light animation curve to play as defined in the `Light.cfx` file\. Valid values are **0** to **48**\. You can also use values **40** to **48** for testing and debugging\.

**Speed**
Multiple of the base animation rate\. For example, a value of **2\.0** makes an animation play twice as fast\.

**Phase**
Animation start offset from **0** to **1**\. A value of **0\.1** is 10% into the animation\. For example, you can use this setting to prevent lights in the same scene, with the same animation, from being animated in unison\.

## Cubemap Generation {#component-environment-probe-cubemap}

See the following cubemap generation settings:

**Cubemap**
Click **Generate** to generate or regenerate a cubemap for this probe\. The button is enabled only when **Use customized cubemap** is deselected\.
Click **Reset** to reset a cubemap for this probe\.

**View cubemap**
Displays a preview of the cubemap in the viewport\. You can only select this option when a cubemap exists\.

**Use customized cubemap**
If selected, you can specify a custom cubemap for **Cubemap asset**\. If deselected, a cubemap is generated\.

**Cubemap asset **
File path for the cubemap asset\.

## EBus Request Bus Interface {#component-environment-probe-ebusrequest}

Use the following request functions with the EBus interface to communicate with other components of your game\.

For more information about using the event bus \(EBus\) interface, see [Working with the Event Bus \(EBus\) system](/docs/userguide/programming/ebus/intro.md)\.

All light components share common EBus functions\. For more information, see [Light Components EBus Request Bus Interface](/docs/userguide/components/area-light#component-light-ebusrequest)\.

  + In the viewport, right\-click and choose **Instantiate slice**\. In the **Pick Slice** dialog box, select a slice, and then click **OK**\.
  + Drag a slice asset from the [**Asset Browser**](/docs/userguide/asset-browser-intro.md) into the viewport\. The slice is instantiated at the drop location\.

# UI Animation Editor {#ui-animation}

You can use animation sequences to animate UI elements in your game's UI\. A UI canvas can contain many named animation sequences\.

The UI **Animation Editor** has the following features:
+ **Menu** - Operations for creating new animation sequences and switching between the **Track Editor** and **Curve Editor**\.
+ **Toolbar** - Tools for the editing and playback of animations\. The **Curve Editor** displays an additional toolbar at the top of the pane\.
+ **Node pane** - Area for showing the active sequence and all of the elements that it is animating\. A track for each animated property appears underneath the related element\.
+ **Editor pane** - Area for either the **Track Editor**, the **Curve Editor**, or both\.

**To show the **Animation Editor** if it is not already visible**
+ From the [**UI Editor**](/docs/userguide/ui/editor/using.md) menu, choose **View**, **Animation Editor**\.

To create an animation sequence, you first create a new sequence, assign one or more UI elements to it, and then record changes you make to the UI element\(s\)-this becomes the animation sequence\. You can then edit the animation sequence\(s\) using the **Animation Editor**\. These processes are described in greater detail in the following sections\.

| This topic references tools and features that are [legacy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lumberyard/latest/userguide/ly-glos-chap.html#legacy)\. If you want to use legacy tools in Lumberyard Editor, disable the [CryEntity Removal gem](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lumberyard/latest/userguide/gems-system-cryentity-removal-gem.html) using the [Project Configurator](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lumberyard/latest/userguide/configurator-intro.html) or the [command line](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lumberyard/latest/userguide/lmbr-exe.html)\. To learn more about legacy features, see the [Lumberyard Legacy Reference](https://d3bqhfbip4ze4a.cloudfront.net/lumberyard-legacy.pdf)\. | 

With Lumberyard's **Database View** editor, you can organize and work within the libraries of your game items\. You can add new or load existing libraries to your level, or remove libraries from your level\. Within a library, you can organize items by customized groups, clone and edit items, assign items to selected objects, and retrieve properties from the current selection\.

The **Database View** editor displays the following categories of libraries on its tabs:
+ **[Entity](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lumberyard/latest/legacyreference/entities-entity-library.html) Library**
+ **[Prefabs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lumberyard/latest/legacyreference/entities-prefabs-intro.html) Library**
+ **[Vegetation](/docs/userguide/vegetation/intro.md)**
+ **[Particles](/docs/userguide/particles/library.md)**
+ **[GameTokens](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lumberyard/latest/legacyreference/fg-tokens.html)**

Using the **Database View** editor's toolbar, you can load, save, or add new libraries, or remove a library\. The drop\-down menu features a list of libraries that you've already opened; select an open library from this list\. Use the **Add new item** tool \(1\) to add items to your library, **Clone library item** \(2\) to create a duplicate of an existing item, and **Remove item** \(3\) to delete the item from the library\. Use **Assign item to selected objects** \(4\) to assign the selected item to objects currently selected in your viewport\. Use **Get properties from selection** \(5\) to use the properties of the object selected in the viewport and apply those properties to the item selected in the item browser\.

The item browser pane \(A\) shows the groups and items that are available in the current library\. The properties pane \(B\) displays the properties of the item selected in the item browser\. Some tabs also feature a preview pane \(C\)\.

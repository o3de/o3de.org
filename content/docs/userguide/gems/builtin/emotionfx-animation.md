# EMotion FX Animation Gem<a name="gems-system-gem-emotionfx-animation"></a>

With the EMotion FX Animation gem, you can use the **EMotion FX Animation Editor** character animation system\. The node\-based system provides an intuitive approach to controlling character behavior from animation graphs\. You can visually build hierarchal state machines and blend trees and use parameter controls for interactive testing\. Character motion is controlled through motion extraction\.

The character animation system includes tools for building the following:
+ Transition conditions
+ Blend spaces
+ Sync tracking
+ Motion events
+ Mirroring animation
+ Controllers

The **Animation Editor** is compatible with `.fbx` files and converts these files to the `.actor` and `.motion` formats\.

For more information, see [Create and animate characters](/docs/userguide/char-intro.md)\.

Enable this gem for your project in the Project Configurator\. For more information, see [Creating a Game Project in Lumberyard](configurator-projects.md#creating-a-game-project)\.

Enable the Render to Texture gem for your game so that you can use the **[Render to Texture](/docs/userguide/components/render-to-texture.md)** component\. You can use this component to render the scene to a texture from the viewport of the selected camera\. For example, you can add game objects such as mirrors, security camera screens, and draw 3D models\.

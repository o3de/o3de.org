# Adding a Depth of Field Node<a name="cinematics-track-view-nodes-dof"></a>

You can use the **Depth of Field** \(DOF\) node to add realism to scenes to simulate the way a real\-world camera works\. You can use a broad depth of field to focus on the entire scene, or use a shallow depth of field to have sharp focus only on objects that are a specific distance from the camera\.

1. For each of the keys listed below, click the applicable key listed under the **DepthOfField** node\.

1. Double\-click to position the key on its highlighted row in the timeline\.

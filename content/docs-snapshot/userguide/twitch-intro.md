# Engaging Broadcasters and Viewers on Twitch<a name="twitch-intro"></a>

Lumberyard is integrated with Twitch so that you can build games that engage with broadcasters and viewers on Twitch\.

**Twitch ChatPlay**  
The Twitch ChatPlay feature within Lumberyard helps you build gameplay that interacts in real time with Twitch viewers\. For example, you can build a game where viewers can vote on game outcomes, gift power\-ups to their favorite players, or change the level based on the number of viewers watching the player\.

**Twitch JoinIn**  
The Twitch JoinIn feature within Lumberyard helps you build multiplayer games that allow Twitch broadcasters to invite fans to join them side by side in the game\. Once invited, a fan can jump into the broadcaster's game with a single click in the Twitch chat channel, while others continue to watch\.

**Twitch API**  
TwitchAPI is a Twitch\-specific implementation of the BroadcastAPI interface that allows you to make calls to Twitch's REST API from within Lumberyard\.

**Twitch C\+\+ API**  
The Twitch C\+\+ API operations allow you to make calls on the TwitchRequestBus and return a unique ReceiptID object\.

**Twitch ChatPlay Lua**  
The Lua scripting functions allow you to add Twitch ChatPlay features to your game project\.

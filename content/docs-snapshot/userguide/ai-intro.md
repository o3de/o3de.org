# Employing artificial intelligence<a name="ai-intro"></a>

In the context of a game, AI refers to the technology or system used to endow seemingly\-intelligent actions and behaviors to an agent or character, called the AI agent\.

Specifically, an AI agent is a game entity that can use information to make decisions in pursuit of one or more goals\. An AI agent can perceive its surroundings, navigate through its environment, interact with other objects, communicate with other agents or players, and exhibit a vast number of various actions and behaviors toward the end goal\. Sophisticated AI behaviors can be triggered, event\-driven or be scripted\.

You can use the **Navigation** group of properties to specify how the arrow keys or gamepad navigates between interactive elements\. 

For each interactive element, you can set navigation to one of the following:
+ **Automatic** – Algorithm determines which interactive elements become focused when up, down, left, or right is pressed\.
+ **Custom** – You manually specify the interactive elements that become focused when up, down, left, or right is pressed\.
+ **None** – This option removes navigation capability; using the keyboard or gamepad, the player cannot focus on this element\.

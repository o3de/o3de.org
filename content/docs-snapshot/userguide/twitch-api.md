# Twitch API<a name="twitch-api"></a>

TwitchAPI is a Twitch\-specific implementation of the BroadcastAPI interface that allows programmers and designers to make calls to Twitch's REST API from within Lumberyard\. For more information, see [Twitch\-API](https://github.com/justintv/Twitch-API)\.

To ensure the TwitchAPI feature functions properly, you must set the `broadcast_ClientID` console variable to use the application's client ID \(provided by Twitch\)\. For more information, see [Generating and Setting a Twitch Client ID](chatplay-generate-twitch-client-id.md)\.

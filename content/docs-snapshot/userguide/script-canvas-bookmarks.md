# Adding Bookmarks for Script Canvas<a name="script-canvas-bookmarks"></a>

A bookmark is a shortcut that you can add to a specific location on your Script Canvas graph\. You can then use keyboard shortcuts to move quickly to that location\. For example, you may have a complex script for a massive character controller that includes sections for movement, camera, and each attack\. You can add a bookmark to each section and then press the keyboard shortcut to move the graph view to the specified section\.
